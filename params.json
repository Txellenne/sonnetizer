{"name":"Sonnetizer","tagline":"","body":"Sonnetizer is a program written by [Ross Goodwin](http://rossgoodwin.com) that generates 14-line rhyming sonnets from any text corpus. It requires Python 2.7, nltk, numpy, and some other standard Python modules to run properly.\r\n\r\nFour versions of Sonnetizer currently exist: sonnetizer\\_a, sonnetizer\\_g, sonnetizer\\_m, and poetron.\r\n\r\nTo run Sonnetizer, download the files along with any text corpus you wish to sonnetize, and enter the following in the command prompt:\r\n\r\n    $ python [sonnetizer file].py [text corpus].txt\r\n\r\n\r\nsonnetizer\\_a.py allows for computer-assisted writing.\r\n\r\nsonnetizer\\_g.py generates 14-line sonnets with 10-syllable lines and the standard ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme.\r\n\r\nsonnetizer\\_m.py generates 14-line sonnets, mostly in iambic pentameter, with 10-syllable lines and the standard ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme.\r\n\r\npoetron.py generates 14-line sonnets with 6-word lines and the standard ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nFor a sample of the output, check out this [book of 10,000 sonnets](http://rossgoodwin.com/10000sonnets.pdf) generated by Sonnetizer from the sonnets of William Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-50113889-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
