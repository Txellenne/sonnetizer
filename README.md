sonnetizer
==========

Sonnetizer is a program written by [Ross Goodwin](http://rossgoodwin.com) that generates 14-line rhyming sonnets from any text corpus. It requires Python 2.7, nltk, numpy, and some other standard Python modules to run properly.

Four versions of Sonnetizer currently exist: sonnetizer\_a, sonnetizer\_g, sonnetizer\_m, and poetron.

To run Sonnetizer, download the files along with any text corpus you wish to sonnetize, and enter the following in the command prompt:

    $ python [sonnetizer file].py [text corpus].txt

* sonnetizer\_a.py allows for computer-assisted writing.
* sonnetizer\_g.py generates 14-line sonnets with 10-syllable lines and the standard ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme.
* sonnetizer\_m.py generates 14-line sonnets, mostly in iambic pentameter, with 10-syllable lines and the standard ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme.
* poetron.py generates 14-line sonnets with 6-word lines and the standard ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme.
